# u8glib-avr
Sources from u8glib AVR library. https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib

**This code was developed by [olikraus](https://github.com/olikraus) and the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib). This is a fork to be used as a submodule and may in future be minimised for my purposes.**

## Why clone u8glib?

This repository allows me to make a git submodule of u8glib instead of pushing it as a commit and making it look like I pushed all the code. Instead, I decided to make this repository of the AVR version of u8glib to be included in `mod-miscr`.

I may modify this in future to minimise the code somewhat for my purposes.
